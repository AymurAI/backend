# Ethics
AymurAI, being a project that aims to use artificial intelligence to tackle gender-based violence and support access to justice, has a strong ethical position. The authors of this project have an anti-solutionist stance and believe that societal problems require societal solutions. This means that they do not expect AI to "solve" the issue of gender-based violence, but rather to serve as a collaborator of human actors with deep knowledge in this field.

The authors of this project subscribe to the feminist epistemological tradition, as well as an intersectional approach that focuses on the triad race-social class-gender. They believe in the principles of challenge power, consider context, and make labor visible. This influences their approach to data science, which is guided by direct experience and a commitment to action and intersectional feminism.

In terms of security and privacy, AymurAI recognizes the importance of protecting the sensitive and personal information of victims of gender-based violence. The project aims to generate and maintain anonymized datasets that will help understand GBV and support policy making. To ensure the protection of personal information, the authors of this project have adopted a closed data approach, with the collaboration of criminal court officials in Argentina and Mexico.

AymurAI is guided by a strong ethical position that considers the complexities of open, gender-sensitive justice from an intersectional, Latin American point of view. The project aims to serve as a collaborator in the fight against gender-based violence and to make a positive contribution towards decreasing it, without compromising the privacy and security of those affected.
